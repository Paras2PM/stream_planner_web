## Stream Planner
Like many of you ðŸ˜…, Iâ€™ve found myself drowning in subscriptions just to keep up with all the TV series I love. It was frustrating to realize I was paying for multiple services and not even using them to their full potential. Thatâ€™s why I decided to build Stream Planner. This free web app is designed to help people like us manage our TV watching more efficiently. You simply mark the shows youâ€™re following, and the app recommends the best streaming services to subscribe to, prioritizing cost and convenience. Now, Iâ€™m saving money and still enjoying all my favorite series without the hassle. Iâ€™m excited to share this with you â€” give it a try, and see how much easier your TV watching can be, without spending a dime!
